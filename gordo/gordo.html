          <p>
            Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of
            NASA's space program. Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions
            before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gordo's historic flight took place on December 13, 1958 when he took
            off from Cape Canaveral for a 15 minute flight into space. Even
            though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments
            indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into space. Scientists
            monitoring the flight were pleased to note that the only slight side
            effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a modest slowing
            of his pulse.

          <p>
            The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the
            Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than any
            monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a
            height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing
            in the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.

            We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first.
            Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up
            to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man
            up to do a monkey's work.

          <p>
            The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was
            originally developed by the US Army as a long-range successor to its
            PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed
            by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the
            United States' early stategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.

          <h2>The Journey</h2>
          <p>
            Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a
            monkey about one foot tall. The space suit was fitted with
            instruments, including temperature meters and microphones which
            recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered one of the
            outstanding achievements of space research.
